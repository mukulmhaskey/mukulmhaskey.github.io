I am Mukul Mhaskey, an astrophysicist-turned-science educator with a deep interest in bridging the gap between cutting-edge research and school education. My journey has taken me from the study of extragalactic radio sources to large-scale science education interventions, where I work to make scientific thinking accessible to students and teachers alike.

##Academic & Research Background
I hold a PhD in Astrophysics from Savitribai Phule Pune University (2015–2020), where my research focused on extremely inverted spectrum radio sources at meter wavelengths. Over the years, I have worked extensively with radio telescopes, engaged in multi-wavelength astrophysical studies, and published research in high-impact international journals such as Astronomy & Astrophysics and MNRAS. My work also included writing telescope proposals (eight of which were successfully approved) and reviewing academic papers.

Beyond my PhD, I worked as a research staff member at the Thüringer Landessternwarte Tautenburg, Germany, contributing to projects on compact radio galaxies and participating in data management initiatives for the PUNCH consortium, where I explored storage and compute infrastructures for large astronomy datasets.

Transition to Science Education
While I have always been passionate about astrophysics, my interest in science education and outreach led me to work at the intersection of research and pedagogy. I have been involved in teacher training, curriculum design, and educational data analysis, focusing on how students learn and construct knowledge in science.

I currently work as a Scientific Officer at the Homi Bhabha Centre for Science Education (HBCSE), TIFR, where I contribute to Vigyan Pratibha, a national-level initiative aimed at enhancing science and mathematics education in higher secondary schools across India. My role involves designing and implementing learning units, training teachers, and developing innovative educational resources that align with constructivist approaches to learning.

Work in Education & Social Impact
Prior to my academic research, I worked as a Program Manager (Data) at Science for All Foundation, Pune (2015–2018), where I led data-driven interventions in low-income schools. I managed a project that documented student and teacher performance data from 45 schools (2,500 students), conducted randomized controlled trials (RCTs) for evaluating learning outcomes, and contributed to teacher training, lesson planning, and assessment design. My work also extended to teaching mathematics and science to students in grades 6–8, giving me firsthand experience in classroom challenges.

Skills & Interests
With experience in Python, MS Office, image and data processing, I integrate technology into education, whether for data-driven decision-making or creating multimedia content for science communication. I have also been involved in organizing science exhibitions, public lectures, and outreach programs, aiming to make science engaging and accessible to diverse audiences.

Vision & Current Interests
My current research in science education focuses on how students’ prior knowledge and misconceptions influence their learning outcomes. I am particularly interested in constructivist approaches, model-based learning, and developing activities that help students critically engage with scientific concepts. I also explore how astronomy education tools like Stellarium can be integrated into school curricula to enhance spatial and conceptual understanding of celestial phenomena.

Through my work, I aim to create a stronger link between scientific research and school education, ensuring that students not only learn science but also develop the skills and mindset of a scientist—curiosity, critical thinking, and problem-solving.
